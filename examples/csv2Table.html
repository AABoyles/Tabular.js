		<span>Looks like an ordinary table, right?  <a onClick='window.location="view-source:" + window.location.href' href="#">View the Source Code</a> to see the magic!</span>

<!-- So far, so good.  Now, check this out: it's plain CSV text that was just
	pasted into a <pre> tag -->

		<div>
Country,Year,Failed State Index
Afghanistan,2005,99
Afghanistan,2006,99.8
Afghanistan,2007,102.3
Albania,2012,66.1212383144

<!-- What just happened?  All I see is CSV!  Where's all the <table> stuff? -->

		<script>
			$(function(){
				$("div").csv2Table(",", true);
			});
		</script>
		
<!-- Ah, cool!  Here's an ordinary jQuery selector that grabs the <div> tag,
	parses its contents as CSV, transforms it to an HTML Table, and
	overwrites the contents of the tag with the table. -->
